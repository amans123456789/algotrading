How to use Indicators?

1. RSI : source - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp
         Technical indicator, used in momentum trading,that measures the speed and magnitude of a
         security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions.
         Traditionally, an RSI above 70 indicates overbought situation and a reading below 30 indicates oversold 
         condition.
         RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above oversold line is often seen as a signal to buy or sell.
         However, RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets. RSI is particularly useful in 
         identifying potential reversals or shifts in market sentiment when prices are moving within a trading range. 
         During trending markets, the RSI may provide less accurate signals, as it could indicate overbought or oversold
         conditions that persist for an extended period during strong trends.
         Reversal indication using RSI: For example, if the RSI can’t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings 
         during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend has weakened and could be reversing lower. 
         The opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 
         70, that downtrend has weakened and could be reversing to the upside. Trend lines and moving averages are 
         helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way.
         
         Not written code on this : A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI displays an oversold reading followed by a 
         higher low that appears with lower lows in the price. This may indicate rising bullish momentum, and a break 
         above oversold territory could be used to trigger a new long position.

         A bearish divergence occurs when the RSI creates an overbought reading followed by a lower high that appears 
         with higher highs on the price.
         Example of Positive-Negative RSI Reversals :
         An additional price-RSI relationship that traders look for is positive and negative RSI reversals. A positive 
         RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a low that is lower than its previous low at the same time 
         that a security's price reaches a low that is higher than its previous low price. Traders would consider this
         formation a bullish sign and a buy signal.
         Conversely, a negative RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a high that is higher that its previous
         high at the same time that a security's price reaches a lower high. This formation would be a bearish sign and 
         a sell signal.

2. Bollinger Band: source - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp, 
                            https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp
         A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines. They are plotted as two standard
         deviations, both positively and negatively, away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price and 
         can be adjusted to user preferences.
         It is a technical analysis tool to generate oversold or overbought signals.
         When the price continually touches the upper Bollinger Band, it can indicate an overbought signal.
         If the price continually touches the lower band it can indicate an oversold signal.
         It should be used in conjugation with other indicators.
         The "squeeze" is the central concept of Bollinger Bands. When the bands come close together, constricting the 
         moving average, it is called a squeeze. A squeeze signals a period of low volatility and is considered by 
         traders to be a potential sign of future increased volatility and possible trading opportunities.
         Conversely, the wider apart the bands move, the more likely the chance of a decrease in volatility and the 
         greater the possibility of exiting a trade. These conditions are not trading signals. The bands do not indicate
         when the change may take place or in which direction the price could move.
3. MACD: source - https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/macddiverge.asp#:~:text=Moving%20average%20convergence%20divergence%20is,and%20exit%20points%20for%20trades.
         Moving average convergence divergence is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship 
         between two moving averages of a security’s price.
         Traders use the MACD to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high to identify entry and exit points for
         trades. There are a number of MACD strategies including the histogram, the crossover, the zero-cross, the money
         flow index, and the relative vigor index. One of the biggest risks of using a MACD is that a reversal signal 
         can be a false indicator.
         Traders can combine RSI, MACD and SMA (Simple Moving Average) - Determine future price changes using the RSI
         Show how strong a trend is and where it's headed using the MACD.
         Use the SMA as a lagging trend-following indicator.
         One of the most significant risks is that a reversal signal can be a false indicator. MACD does not function 
         well in sideways markets. If prices generally move to the side when they stay within a range between support 
         and resistance. MACD tends to drift toward the zero line because there is no up or down trend—where the moving 
         average works best.

4. ATR: source - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp#:~:text=The%20average%20true%20range%20(ATR)%20is%20a%20technical%20analysis%20indicator,asset%20price%20for%20that%20period.
         The average true range (ATR) is a market volatility indicator used in technical analysis. It is typically 
         derived from the 14-day simple moving average of a series of true range indicators.
         The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and is a useful tool to add to a trading 
         system. It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using 
         simple calculations. The indicator does not indicate the price direction; instead, it is used primarily to 
         measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. 
         For eg. The chandelier exit places a trailing stop under the highest high the stock has reached since you 
         entered the trade. The distance between the highest high and the stop level is defined as some multiple 
         multiplied by the ATR.

5. ADX: source - https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp
         it is often hard to see when price moves from trend to range conditions. ADX shows when the trend has weakened 
         and is entering a period of range consolidation. Range conditions exist when ADX drops from above 25 to below 
         25 In a range, the trend is sideways, and there is general price agreement between the buyers and sellers.

         ADX gives great strategy signals when combined with price. First, use ADX to determine whether prices are 
         trending or non-trending, and then choose the appropriate trading strategy for the condition. In trending 
         conditions, entries are made on pullbacks and taken in the direction of the trend. In range conditions, 
         trend-trading strategies are not appropriate. However, trades can be made on reversals at support (long) and 
         resistance (short)
6. Stochastic oscillator: source - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp
         https://www.alpharithms.com/stochastic-oscillator-in-python-483214/
         A stochastic oscillator is a popular technical indicator for generating overbought and oversold signals
         Stochastic oscillators tend to vary around some mean price level since they rely on an asset's price history
         Stochastic oscillators measure the momentum of an asset's price to determine trends and predict reversals
         Stochastic oscillators measure recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with measurements above 80 indicating that
         an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold. very strong trends can maintain
         overbought or oversold conditions for an extended period. Instead, traders should look to changes in the 
         stochastic oscillator for clues about future trend shift
         the RSI was designed to measure the speed of price movements, while the stochastic oscillator formula works 
         best in consistent trading ranges.

What I did ?

RSI: (trend_functions.py) -  if RSI is above upper_limit, it is termed as Overbought else if it is below a lower limit, 
it is termed as Oversold.
Bollinger Band: if Open price is above Upper Bollinger, it is termed as Overbought else if it is below Lower Bollinger, 
it is termed as Oversold.
MACD: Cross-over strategy used in code
ATR: A user defined multiplier is taken and if the closing price is more than opening price + multiplier times ATR or 
It is marked as bullish, similar for bearish.
ADX: If, di+ > di- , adx is rising and adx is above threshold than marked as bullish (logic of adx rising removed)
Stochastic Oscillator: if %k > %d and %k < overbought_threshold, it is labelled bullish signal
if %k < %d and %k > oversold_threshold, it is labelled bearish signal

Additional Ideas:
RSI: Write Bullish and Bearish reversal indicator using RSI as explained in description of RSI above
     Write Bullish and Bearish momentum indicator using RSI as explained in description of RSI above
     Note: More functions on RSI written in "TimeSeries_features_on_clustered_stock_data" notebook for future use
Bollinger Band: Add the concept of squeeze with bollinger bands
MACD: Can try using other (zero-cross etc) MACD approaches
ADX : Add the logic of adx volatility - ADX Value	Trend Strength
0-25	Absent or Weak Trend
25-50	Strong Trend
50-75	Very Strong Trend
75-100	Extremely Strong Trend
Stochastic Oscilator:
Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal.
For example, when a bearish trend reaches a new lower low, but the oscillator prints a higher low, it may be an indicator that bears are exhausting their momentum and a bullish reversal is brewing.

Shortcomings of current iteration:
1. RSI looks only for overbought and oversold
2. Bollinger Band's squeeze concept can be added, however, squeeze is not a direct trading signal
3. Didn't explore combining MACD with other indicators. 
4. ADX is to be combined with price movement. ADX can tell when price breakout is strong and can sustain (read source link )
5. It can give false signals, to improve signals, add the condition that price trend are in same direction as the 
oscillator's signal
